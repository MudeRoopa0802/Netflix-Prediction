# Netflix Stock Price Prediction üìà

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning workflow to predict Netflix (NFLX) stock prices using **Linear Regression**. It walks through data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation using Python and scikit-learn.

##  Dataset

The dataset used is `NFLX.csv`, which contains historical stock data for Netflix. It is expected to include columns such as:
- Date
- Open
- High
- Low
- Close
- Volume

>  Make sure `NFLX.csv` is placed in the same directory when running the notebook.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Load stock data and inspect the first few rows.
   - Check for missing values.

2. **Data Visualization**
   - Visualize stock trends and distributions.

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Feature selection and train-test split.

4. **Model Building**
   - Train a Linear Regression model on the training set.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics:
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
     - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
     - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
     - R¬≤ Score

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## üìÅ File Structure

##  Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Place `NFLX.csv` in the root folder.
3. Open `ML_project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
4. Run the cells sequentially to see the results.
